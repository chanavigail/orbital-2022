**Team #5436 DineTogether**

**Proposed Level of Achievement:** Apollo 11

**Motivation**

Due to the restrictions implemented during the pandemic, seats in the dining halls (DH) of student residences and other canteens in NUS (eateries, for short) are limited. As such, it’s sometimes difficult to find a seat and dine in, especially during the peak hours around 12pm and 7pm (lunch and dinner time respectively). 

Many of us resort to standing around in the eatery waiting for a table to be cleared up. Even if there are available seats, it is sometimes awkward to ask strangers if you can share their table, or take their table when they are done eating. 

**Aim**

We hope to give students an avenue to meet new people and make friends by having meals in the DH of student residences and other canteens in NUS together.

**User Stories**

1. As a resident who is unable to find seats in the DH/other eateries, I want to be able to quickly find people to share a table with when seats are limited.

2. As a student that might not have many friends in NUS due to the difficulty of making friends over zoom,  I want to be able to meet new people by having a meal together.

3. As an administrator who wants to prevent abuse of the system, I want to be able to identify abusers, warn them and ban them if they continue to cause problems.


**Features**

The Telegram Bot provides a quick and convenient interface to check the general availability of seats and a list of friends who are currently in the DH. 

A Mobile Application that will share a common database with the Telegram Bot and provide greater functionality with a traditional non-chat-based interface. This will include different menus for seat availability, a friends list and their statuses, and user base-wide polls.

Features to be completed by the mid of June: 

The Telegram bot has limited features (cannot display all friends and their statuses, cannot look for new friends/specific available tables) due to limited screen space and the potential notification spam. 


1. Telegram Bot
Allow users to check the number of seats available in the DH/canteen.
Allow users to see which friends are currently dining at the location.

2. Mobile App
Allow users to add friends and see when their friends are going for lunch/dinner.
Users can also send requests to existing friends to get a meal together.
Users who want to meet new people can put up a table invitation that non-friends can accept.
Allow a group of friends to check the availability of tables to reduce waiting time.

3. Mechanisms to collect datasets for analysis

Features to be completed by the mid of July: 

1. Providing recommendations with machine learning (eg. ‘speed dials’ for friends who you eat often, new friends who you might click with, etc).
