**Team #5436 DineTogether**

**Proposed Level of Achievement:** Apollo 11

**Motivation**

Due to the restrictions implemented during the pandemic, seats in the dining halls (DH) of student residences and other canteens in NUS (eateries, for short) are limited. As such, it’s sometimes difficult to find a seat and dine in, especially during the peak hours around 12pm and 7pm (lunch and dinner time respectively). 

Many of us resort to standing around in the eatery waiting for a table to be cleared up. Even if there are available seats, it is sometimes awkward to ask strangers if you can share their table, or take their table when they are done eating. 

**Aim**

We hope to give students an avenue to meet new people and make friends by having meals in the DH of student residences and other canteens in NUS together and also reduce time wasted waiting for tables.

**User Stories**

1. As a resident who is unable to find seats in the DH/other eateries, I want to be able to quickly find people to share a table with when seats are limited.

2. As a student that might not have many friends in NUS due to the difficulty of making friends over zoom,  I want to be able to meet new people by having a meal together.

3. As an administrator who wants to prevent abuse of the system, I want to be able to identify abusers, warn them and ban them if they continue to cause problems.


**Features** 

1. Telegram Bot
- Provides a quick and convenient interface to check the general availability of seats/tables in the DH/canteen

2. Web App
- Allow users to add friends and see when their friends are going for lunch/dinner.
- Users can also send requests to existing friends to get a meal together.
- Users who want to meet new people can put up a table invitation that non-friends can accept.
- Allow a group of friends to check the availability of tables to reduce waiting time.
- Recommendations will be provided with machine learning (eg. ‘speed dials’ for friends who you eat often, new friends who you might click with, etc)
